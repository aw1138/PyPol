# PyPol

PyPol is a Python module made specifically to work with spectropolarimetric data. 


### What it does:

Currently, it can make spectrapolarimetric light curves from U Wisconsin HPOL data for the system V367 Cyg (with and without ISP removal). I'm working on making it able to work with other observatories and targets soon.

The culmination (and really the only thing you need to run) is the find_pol function.

### On the update to do list is:

- allowing for different targets and observatories
- adding plotting capability for the lcs
- streamlining and simplifying (mostly get_pol)
